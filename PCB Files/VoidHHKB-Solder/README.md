## Flashing Firmware

1) Install and launch [QMK Toolbox](https://qmk.fm/toolbox)

2) Connect PCB via USB. Hold down reset button to enter bootloader

3) Under 'Local file' open firmware/void_voidhhkb_via.bin. Everything else can be left as default (MCU is STM32F072 / STM32 DFU — QMK Toolbox auto-detects it in bootloader mode)

4) Click Flash!

5) Unplug and plug in again to complete set up


## Using VIA

Temp instructions until I get around to merging files into QMK repo...
1) To edit keymap in via open web page and select 'Design' on the top ribbon

2) Click 'Load Draft Definition' and load '/firmware/voidhhkb/via.json'

## Build your own firmware

- Files have been included under 'firmware' if you want to build the bin files yourself.
- This is fairly trivial to do by following the [QMK Tutorial](https://docs.qmk.fm/newbs)
